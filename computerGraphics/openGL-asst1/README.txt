Provide instructions on how to compile and run your code, especially if you used a nonstandard Makefile, or you are one of those hackers who insists on doing things differently.

Nothing new, just build and run.

Indicate if you met all problem set requirements (more importantly, let us know where your bugs are and what you did to try to eliminate the bugs; we want to give you as much partial credit as we can).

Yes, we were able to achieve all problem statements.

Provide some overview of the code design. Don't go into details; just give us the big picture.

Pretty much followed the requirements. For the triangle, followed the same way the square shader was done. The three vertex colours in the triangle independently emphasise R, G, and B colours over the texture.

Let us know how to run the program; what are the hot keys, mouse button usage, and so on? Describe steps or sequences of steps the TF should take to test and evaluate your code (especially if your implmenentation strays from the assignment specification).

Same way as the staff example.

Finally, did you implement anything above and beyond the problem set? If so, document it in order for the TFs to test it and evaluate it.

We added :

Reset Triangle Position : Pressing the R Key resets the triangle position, with dynamic resizing and relative position maintenance.
